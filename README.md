## Project Overview
UBID is an online auction system designed to help a traditional on-site auction business expand their operations to the internet. Our goal is to create a platform similar to eBay, where users can buy and sell items through online auctions.

## Project Duration
6 Weeks

## Project Goals
- Develop a functional online auction system.
- Implement user registration, item listing, bidding, and reporting features.
- Learn about web development, database design, and project management.

## Project Phases and Timelines

### Week 1: Requirement Gathering and Analysis
- Meet with stakeholders to understand their needs.
- Collect detailed requirements via interviews and questionnaires.
- Document the functional and non-functional requirements.

### Week 2: Analysis and Approval
- Analyze the current on-site auction processes.
- Create a detailed requirements specification document.
- Obtain client approval for the requirements.

### Week 3: System Design
- Design the system architecture with use case diagrams, class diagrams, and sequence diagrams.
- Develop the database schema for users, items, categories, bids, and reports.

### Week 4: UI Design and Review
- Create wireframes for the user interfaces, including the home page, registration, login, item listing, and bidding pages.
- Review wireframes and database schema with the client for feedback.

### Week 5: Finalize Design
- Finalize the system design based on client feedback.
- Prepare detailed design documents.

### Week 6: Initial Implementation
- Set up the development environment (servers, databases, frameworks).
- Implement user registration and login functionalities.
- Develop the user profile management module.
- Begin integration and testing of implemented functionalities.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this project, we aim to:
- Gain practical experience in web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.
- Understand the process of gathering and documenting client requirements.
- Learn how to design and implement a database schema.
- Develop skills in creating wireframes and system design documents.
- Experience the full software development lifecycle from planning to implementation.

## Communication Plan
- Weekly status meetings on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 6:00 P.M.
- Bi-weekly status reports to provide detailed progress updates.
- Prompt email updates for urgent issues or changes.

## Final Deliverables
- A fully functional online auction system.
- User documentation and training materials.
- A project closure report detailing the development process and final product.
